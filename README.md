# Student-Budget-Buddy
Student Budget Buddy is a simple, easy-to-use multi-user finance tracker made for students. It helps users register, create budgets, add transactions, and see summaries â€” all from the command line. The project focuses on clear structure (OOP), file-based persistence, and straightforward features so it is easy to understand and extend.
